# Random_Forest
# PROJECT TITLE :
Classify the Random Forest Algorithm using sklearn classifier "RandomForestClassifier" for "iris.csv",and predict the data how many species are interconnected with Nth DecisionTree Node
# Tasks
1.import random forest classifier by using sklearn.ensemble library
2.Load your data using seaborn graphics library as an argument load_iris()
3.Pre-processes the data using skitlearn graphics library
4.Select the model using "model_selection" prompt sns as seaborn and sklearn as a machine learn library
5.Load iris.csv dataset for "data" as a input variable and "target" as a functionable output variable
6.Pick the train and test data using argumental library train_test_split
7.select the estimators as a Nth DecisionTree
8.Use a RandomForest classifier and fit your model
9.Find your Model Accuracy

# Conclusion :
My model has approach 1.00 accuracy ,which lies between in the range of 0-1
Hence it shows that RandomForest Decision Model successfully implemented
